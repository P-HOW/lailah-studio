Lailah Studio is an open-source, web-based application inspired by Stability AI’s DreamStudio, designed for creating and editing AI-generated images. Built with a plugin system, it allows developers to swap out back-ends and integrate their own, while removing platform-specific branding and account features like billing or API management.

The project is simple to set up with Node.js and Yarn, and runs locally at localhost:3000. While DreamStudio remains Stability’s hosted deployment, Lailah Studio focuses on community-driven development, encouraging contributions ranging from bug fixes and documentation to new features and plugins.
